Measure of uncertainty: It is tempting to think of probability as representing some natural randomness in the world. That might be the case. But perhaps the world isn't random. I propose a deeper way of thinking about probability. There is so much that we as humans don't know, and probability is our robust language for expressing our belief that an event will happen given our limited knowledge. This interpretation acknowledges your own uncertainty of an event. Perhaps if you knew the position of every water molecule, you could perfectly predict tomorrow's weather. But we don't have such knowledge and as such we use probability to talk about the chance of rain tomorrow given the information that we have access to.
Origins of probabilities: The different interpretations of probability are reflected in the many origins of probabilities that you will encounter in the wild (and not so wild) world. Some probabilities are calculated analytically using mathematical proofs. Some probabilities are calculated from data, experiments or simulations. Some probabilities are just made up to represent a belief. Most probabilities are generated from a combination of the above. For example, someone will make up a prior belief, that belief will be mathematically updated using data and evidence. Here is an example of calculating a probability from data:
