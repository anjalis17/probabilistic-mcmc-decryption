WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question, which, in
its consequences, must prove one of the most important that ever engaged their attention, the
propriety of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will be evident.
Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally
undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their
natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of consideration therefore,
whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of America that they should, to all
general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide
themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which
they are advised to place in one national government. It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion, that the prosperity of the people of
America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best
and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians now appear, who
insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union,
we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties. However
extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain characters
who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of the number.
