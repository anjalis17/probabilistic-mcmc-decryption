As climate impacts intensify, adaptation action
continues to fall behind needs. The twenty-ninth
Session of the Conference of the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (COP 29) in Baku provides an important
opportunity to alter this trajectory.
Ever more frequent and extreme climate impacts illustrate
just how much is at stake as global average temperatures
rapidly approach 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, while
mitigation action is woefully underachieving on the
scale and ambition needed to keep within the long-term
temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. As climate
impacts rise with warming, both the costs of reducing
risks through adaptation and the likelihood of the residual
risks manifesting in the form of losses and damages
increase. These climate impacts hit the poor and vulnerable
hardest, including women and disadvantaged groups.
Effective and adequate adaptation action incorporating
elements of fairness and equity is thus more urgent than
ever before. By strengthening the adaptation components
in their third set of nationally determined contributions
(NDCs), due in February 2025, Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) can
emphasize their adaptation priorities and the means needed
to achieve them.
