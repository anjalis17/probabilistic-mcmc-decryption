“GOOD EVENING,” SAID LUCY. BUT THE Faun was so busy picking
up its parcels that at first it did not reply. When it had finished it
made her a little bow.
“Good evening, good evening,” said the Faun. “Excuse me—I don’t
want to be inquisitive—but should I be right in thinking that you are
a Daughter of Eve?”
“My name’s Lucy,” said she, not quite understanding him.
“But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a girl?” asked the
Faun.
“Of course I’m a girl,” said Lucy.
“You are in fact Human?”

never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted.
That is to say—” and then it stopped as if it had been going to say
something it had not intended but had remembered in time.
“Delighted, delighted,” it went on. “Allow me to introduce myself. My
name is Tumnus.”
“I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus,” said Lucy.
“And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve,” said Mr. Tumnus, “how
you have come into Narnia?”
“Narnia? What’s that?” said Lucy.
“This is the land of Narnia,” said the Faun, “where we are now; all
that lies between the lamppost and the great castle of Cair Paravel on
the eastern sea. And you—you have come from the wild woods of the
west?”
“I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,” said Lucy.
“Ah!” said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, “if only I had
worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no
doubt know all about those strange countries.
